# üêçPython:

Python is an interpreted, high-level, object-oriented programming language with dynamic semantics. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is known for its simple, easy-to-read syntax, which emphasizes readability and reduces the cost of program maintenance. It supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.

Python is widely used in various domains, including:

1. Web development (both frontend and backend) [3].
2. Data science and data analysis [6].
3. Machine learning and artificial intelligence [6].
4. Automation and scripting [4].
5. Software development and testing [3].
Its extensive standard library and the presence of third-party libraries make it versatile and powerful for many types of software development projects.


## üìîCourse Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of the course, students will be able to:
1. Develop, document, and debug modular python programs to solve computational problems.
2. Select a suitable programming construct and data structure for a situation.
3. Use built-in strings, lists, sets, tuples and dictionary in applications.
4. Define classes and use them in applications.
5. Use files for I/O operations.
